# Dulsafn

Dulsafn is intended to be a crypto currency portfolio mobile app on iOS and Android. Made in JavaScript & [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

There are a lot of crypto portfolio apps out there, for example [Blockfolio](http://blockfolio.com/) or more recent addition [Delta](https://getdelta.io/). I do not intend to compete with those, the main purpose of this side project will be to experiment and learn. In fact Delta has the majority of the features that I wanted so I have been putting this project on hold.

Dulsafn is an Icelandic word. Dul: crypto/secret/mistery, safn: portfolio.
